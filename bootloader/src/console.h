 * @author Jakob Kastelic
 * @copyright 2026 Jakob Kastelic
 *
 * This module sits below the command interpreter.  It owns the character
 * ring buffer and the Ctrl-C interrupt flag so that:
 *   - setup.c (UART IRQ) can push characters without depending on cmd.h
 *   - fmc.c (long operations) can check for interruption without depending
 *     on cmd.h
 *   - cmd.c depends on console.h, not the other way around
 */

 * Ctrl-C (0x03) sets the interrupt flag instead of enqueuing. */
